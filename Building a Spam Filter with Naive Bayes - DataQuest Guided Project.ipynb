    "# Building a Spam Filter with Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we're going to study the practical side of the algorithm by building a spam filter for SMS messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "To classify messages as spam or non-spam, the computer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learns how humans classify messages.\n",
    "2. Uses that human knowledge to estimate probabilities for new messages — probabilities for spam and non-spam.\n",
    "3. Classifies a new message based on these probability values — if the probability for spam is greater, then it classifies the message as spam. Otherwise, it classifies it as non-spam (if the two probability values are equal, then we may need a human to classify the message).\n",
    "\n",
    "So our first task is to \"teach\" the computer how to classify messages. To do that, we'll use the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm along with a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that are already classified by humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, and it can be downloaded from the [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection). We can also download the dataset directly [from this link](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/433/SMSSpamCollection). The data collection process is described in more details on [this page](http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago/smsspamcollection/#composition), where we can also find some of the authors' papers.\n",

    "We read in the dataset and saw that about 87% of the messages are ham (\"ham\" means non-spam), and the remaining 13% are spam. Now that we've become a bit familiar with the dataset, we can move on to building the spam filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, before creating it, it's very helpful to first think of a way of testing how well it works. When creating software (a spam filter is software), a good rule of thumb is that designing the test comes before creating the software. If we write the software first, then it's tempting to come up with a biased test just to make sure the software passes it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once our spam filter is done, we'll need to test how good it is with classifying *new* messages. To test the spam filter, we're first going to split our dataset into two categories:\n",
    "\n",

    "+ A **test set**, which we'll use to test how good the spam filter is with classifying new messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to keep 80% of our dataset for training, and 20% for testing (we want to train the algorithm on as much data as possible, but we also want to have enough test data). The dataset has 5,572 messages, which means that:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The training set will have 4,458 messages (about 80% of the dataset).\n",
    "+ The test set will have 1,114 messages (about 20% of the dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the purpose of putting a test set aside, let's begin by observing that all 1,114 messages in our test set are already classified by a human. When the spam filter is ready, we're going to treat these messages as new and have the filter classify them. Once we have the results, we'll be able to compare the algorithm classification with that done by a human, and this way we'll see how good the spam filter really is.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, our goal is to create a spam filter that classifies new messages with an accuracy greater than 80% — so we expect that more than 80% of the new messages will be classified correctly as spam or ham (non-spam).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a training and a test set. We're going to start by randomizing the entire dataset to ensure that spam and ham messages are spread properly throughout the dataset."
